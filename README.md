# How to install?
You first of all have to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Now you have got to install the required libs, you can do that by opening a terminal then head to this file's location and type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
after doing that accuratley you have to change some stuff within the game's setting for this to work without any troubles

# Important:
- The enemies must be in **MAGENTA**, you can change that from settings > accessibility > blind colors and then set targets to magenta.
- Overwatch's client must be in the fullscreen windowed fullscreen mode
- Targets will only be targeted if they're within the defined `MAX_TARGET_DISTANCE`
and the `Caps Lock` key is held down (you can change this if you want)
